<h1> Sahara </h1>

<p>
   when you visit sahara you will see Some stones are perfectly rounded as they would be processed by some machine. You can see marble mountains getting out of stone and sand desert, partially covered by sand. Enjoy sand dunes all around, making incredible landscape. In between all of that you can suddenly discover oasis, places full of green and water, small villages and people in between of the dry land. The most surprising is to see wild animal in the desert.
